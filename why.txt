# what i am building
# i am building an website for myself similar to a portfoliowebsite

# why i am building this website 
# from a long time i had this idea to build something for me that can represent me in the internet
# but i was confused about which languague to use which frame works to use etc..

# i recent days i came up with something called django which is a python frame work for building webapplications
# why django i know a decent bit of python and thats it i choose it and have started doing the project
# hope it would turn out to be successfull
